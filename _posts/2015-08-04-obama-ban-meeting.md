"Climate change and violence in Syria, Libya, and Yemen dominated President Obama's discussion Tuesday with United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, the leaders said Tuesday."

The meeting was right after Obama's announcement on new power plant emissions policies.  I wonder if the announcement was timed to give them something to talk about and give climate change a bump in the news.
