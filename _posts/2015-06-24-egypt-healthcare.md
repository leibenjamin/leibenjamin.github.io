Not IR, just domestic besides the mention of brain drain.  A bit depressing, since Egypt is usually seen as one of the big players in Africa and the Middle East, though this is just one of the many problems Egypt currently faces.

"The quality of care is so poor that many Egyptians shun the state-run system. A government insurance programme covers public workers, their families and schoolchildren—about 54% of the population. But only 8% of those insured in this way use public outpatient clinics."

"Mahmoud Beshir, a doctor in Port Said, says he makes about $200 per month, which is close to the civil-service minimum wage."
 
"Some join the private sector, where they earn much more. Others go abroad. There are more Egyptian doctors in Saudi Arabia than there are in Egypt’s primary-care system."

"About 500 of Egypt’s 4,000 state-run clinics do not even have a doctor."
