"IN FEBRUARY and April the German blog Netzpolitik.org published two posts with leaked information about the plans of Germany’s secret service to expand its digital-surveillance budget. They received little attention, in part because of a surfeit of German media coverage about government snooping in the aftermath of Edward Snowden’s revelations. In the context, Netzpolitik’s scoop seemed small.

But on July 24th the blog’s publishers, Andre Meister and Markus Beckedahl (pictured), received a letter from Germany’s federal prosecutor saying that they and their anonymous sources were being investigated—for treason. This pressed not one, but two German panic buttons: data privacy and press freedom."

I wonder what the status of norms on surveillance, security, privacy, and press freedom will be in 10, 20, 50 years.  These conflicting priorities really have been facing off a lot in recent years.
