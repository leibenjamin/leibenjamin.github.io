Ethnic disputes seem to bring out the worst in people, both in China's treatment of the Uyghurs and the oft-racist Turkish protests against China.

Putting that aside, one paragraph was interesting.

"Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Turkeyâ€™s president, sees high strategic stakes. He says he would ditch efforts to join the European Union if Turkey were accepted by the Shanghai Co-operation Organisation (SCO), formed in 2001 by China, Russia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan and Tajikistan. The SCO 'is better and more powerful, and we have common values with them,' Mr Erdogan declared."

Sounds like bluster, but it's still a bit hilarious that Erdogan would say this.  I'm sure Erdogan has noticed the track record of other nearby countries who've been trying to play off the EU against Russia.
