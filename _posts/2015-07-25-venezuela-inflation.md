Pretty scary stuff.  I wonder what top monetary policy economists would recommend; Venezuela's current route seems blatantly unsustainable, especially if oil prices don't rise soon.

"This month Venezuela’s currency, the bolívar, passed a melancholy milestone: its value on the black market is now a hundredth of what it is supposed to be at the main official exchange rate. The government insists that there are 6.3 bolívares to the dollar, but it will cost you 630 to buy one from a willing seller. As the country’s stock of hard currency shrinks and the central bank prints money to plug a huge budget deficit, the bolívar’s collapse is accelerating (see chart). It is worth a thousandth of what it was in 1999, when Hugo Chávez, Venezuela’s late autocrat, came to power.

The country may be on the verge of hyperinflation. Most economists reckon that the inflation rate is already 120% a year (the central bank stopped publishing price data, so no one is sure). Some expect it to reach 200% by the end of 2015.

The government uses a labyrinthine system of price and exchange controls to shield Venezuelans from soaring prices. But these make matters worse. Price ceilings have devastated local production; factories are operating at half-capacity and more than two-thirds of food is imported."

One interesting tidbit is the role of tech and social media:
"Venezuelans check prices on the Twitter account of DolarToday, a Miami-based outfit which publishes updates based on transactions in the Colombian border town of Cúcuta. This is where Colombians go to exchange pesos for bolívares, often to buy cheap fuel and other price-controlled goods in Venezuela for smuggling across the border. Transactions are few; the dollar rate is calculated indirectly, from the value of the Colombian peso. The result is erratic, but more realistic than the three official rates. Although it is illegal, many Venezuelan retailers mark prices based on deals struck in the Colombian backwater.

The government of Nicolás Maduro, Chávez’s hapless heir, calls the website a conspiracy to sabotage the economy and has tried repeatedly to block it."
