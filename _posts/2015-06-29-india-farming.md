Huh.  I didn't realize that agriculture was still such a substantial part of India's employment: nearly 50%.  It only contributes 13.7% of India's GDP nowadays, and both growth and productivity rates have been slower for agriculture than the general economy.  India's government has been propping up rural areas with welfare and subsidies, but that doesn't appear to be enough.

A frequent criticism of India's aspirations for international power is that it has too many domestic problems that still need addressing.
