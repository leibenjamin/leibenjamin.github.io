"Now the police want to take their professionalism abroad as part of a self-styled “K-police wave”—in emulation of a Korean wave of popular culture that has carried soaps and singers around the world. Since 2005 the police have invited almost 1,000 officers from 69 countries, from Niger to Indonesia, for training. The programme’s budget has just been increased fivefold, to $20m over four years. A new centre aims to send 300 South Korean cops abroad by 2018."

They're making some money from the sale of police gear too.  A soft power of sorts, combined with a business opportunity?
