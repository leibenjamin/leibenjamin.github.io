"Seven long years ago Congress passed a law requiring beef and pork sold in America to be labelled with its country of origin. Canada and Mexico, which export lots of meat to America, denounced the measure as protectionism and complained to the World Trade Organisation (WTO). Last month it ruled in their favour, prompting Canada to ask the WTOâ€™s permission this week to impose retaliatory tariffs of $2.5 billion on American exports. Mexico plans to submit a similar request soon."

Article speaks for itself.  It's just interesting how this dispute played out and how each actor reacted.
