Essentially, The Economist describes the ways Ramzan Kadyrov rules Chechnya as his personal fiefdom in the style of Turkmenistan, and "some observes say he is the second-most powerful man in Russia after Vladimir Putin."

It's possible that The Economist was exaggerating, but I did not know of how much power he has.  For example, "men linked to Kadyrov's security services were charged with the murder in February of Boris Nemtsov, an opposition politician, outside the Kremlin," and Kadyrov has his own army of 20,000 that answers only to him.
