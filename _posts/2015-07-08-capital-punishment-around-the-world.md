Just a short article overview of capital punishment policies around the world.  Overall, the number of countries using capital punishment has gone done--over 100 have banned the death penalty, and another 40 do not use it but still retain the laws.

"In December a record 117 countries voted for a moratorium at the UN General Assembly; 37 voted against and 34 abstained. The number voting yes was notably higher than in 2007.

In 1994 80% of Americans said they endorsed the death penalty in principle. The Pew Research Centre reckons that fewer than 60% do so todayâ€”and notes that young Americans are less keen than their elders. Blacks are solidly against, as are a small majority of Hispanics."

What will be the status of international norms on capital punishment in 10 years?  20 years?  50?
