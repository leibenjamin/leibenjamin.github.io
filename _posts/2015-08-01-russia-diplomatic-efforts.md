Article is an overview of Russia's recent diplomatic, economic, and military initiatives.  Highlights include Russia's enthusiastic participation in BRICS and the Shanghai Co-operation Organization to counter the Western financial system, Russia's promotion of "traditional values", and Putin's July 26th announcement of a new naval doctrine that aspires to challenge NATO in all areas of operation, instead of Russia's current aging fleet.  I hope regular Russian citizens won't increasingly buy into the current Kremlin narrative, but the polls look depressing.
