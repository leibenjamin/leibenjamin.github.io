Just interesting to see the transnational efforts to stop fake goods at borders and the private lawsuits to stop companies like Alibaba from having fake goods on their online marketplaces.  I presume that current trade deals like the TPP are also trying tackle this problem, though there are worries that the rules will be too restricting for digital products.
