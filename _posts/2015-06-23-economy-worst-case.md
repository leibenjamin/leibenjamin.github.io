**\[16m podcast\]**

Planet Money covers several situations that US economists might find worrisome.  Nice to see more publicity for the dependency ratio.  Also has a bit from Robert Shiller about the current cyclically adjusted price-to-earnings (CAPE) ratio, which is reaching historic peaks.  Podcast concludes that while there are several possible problems, none will likely affect the US economy anytime soon.
