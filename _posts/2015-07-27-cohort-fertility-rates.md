Just a reminder that the nuances of popular statistics matter.  Just like how the distributions of fertility rates by geographic, cultural, and ethnic grousp matter, the differences by age cohort matter too.

"The broad picture is the same: places with low total fertility also have low cohort fertility. But the new measure gives some countries cause for cheer. German women born in 1979 are expected to have more children, on average, than those born in 1970. The same is true of French ones. Even the Japanese seem to have become a little more fecund, starting with those born in the mid-1970s. But South Korea is still on a steep downward slope."
