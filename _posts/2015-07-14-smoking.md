Essentially, smoking rates are still rising in many countries, even though we now know how to get people to quit: "hike taxes, ban smoking indoors and advertising, publicise the health risis and help smokers to quit".  Countries that have implemented these have seen rates drop almost 10% in 5-10 years.  The article covers many of the implementation nuances and results.

Two aspects related to IR:

1) The WHO is helping to do lots of the naming and shaming via its reports.

2) Odd situations pop up where western multinationals use legislative and judicial means to maintain their interests abroad.  E.g. "On July 2nd, in a case brought by British American Tobacco, Kenyaâ€™s High Court suspended the new tobacco rules that would have taken effect last month. They had been eight years in the making. The court found that the constitution required that the company be consulted."
