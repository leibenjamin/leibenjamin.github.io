Nothing particularly interesting, besides as a data point when looking at the status of the global economy.  Canada's economy has finally begun to wobble after staying high for years while most developed countries went through financial crises.  It appears that the decline in commodity prices are particularly hurting the Canadian economy.  They've even recently lowered interest rates even as other countries are considering raising them.
