"PJ Vogt’s friend plays a trick on some girl scouts. The trick doesn’t work. The girl scouts don’t realize they’re being pranked. And in trying to figure out why, PJ comes across a logbook that tells him a secret history about the power of the girl scouts’ unrelenting cheerfulness."

This American Life segment that starts with a comedian trying to play a prank on local girl scout emails, but leads to a story of girl scouts (internationally: "girl guides") keeping up the morale in a foreigner internment camp in China during WWII.  An IO playing its part well in dark times.
