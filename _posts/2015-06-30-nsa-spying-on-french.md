Basically, it was revealed by WikiLeaks that the NSA had been spying on the phone calls of three consecutive French Presidents (Chirac, Sarkozy, Hollande) from 2006-2012.  Not a surprise, since the US had already been discovered to be monitoring leaders' communications from around the world.

I'm curious how much of US (and other countries') espionage is used for shaping policy on non-security issues.  It's obviously an open-ended question, since we only hear tidbits every once in a while.
