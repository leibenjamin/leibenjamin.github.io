Nothing particularly new, just representative of The Economist's current consensus on the issue.  Excerpts:

"In every rich country except Israel the total fertility rate (a measure of births per woman) is below 2.1—the level required to keep the population stable.

In Europe a single child is reckoned to cost 20-30% of household income.

At least in the rich world, the more governments spend, the more they seem to get (see chart). Nordic countries shell out the most and are rewarded with more babies; stingy Mediterranean countries have the fewest babies in Europe. The causation may not be all one-way, of course. It could be that more babies means a bigger parents’ lobby, which can vote fatter benefits for itself.

Longer maternity and paternity leave are nice but seem not to encourage childbearing. Cash payments and gifts encourage couples to have babies more quickly but not to have more than they otherwise would.

The clear winner, according to Mr Thévenon’s research, is subsidised child care. Decent, affordable nurseries make it easier for women to combine work and motherhood. They seem to be the main reason France and Sweden have robust fertility rates—though mass immigration from more fecund countries has helped them a little, too."
