Since the Greek debt crowdfunding campaign has been in the news, I feel obligated to mention that the US has accepted donations to reduce its public debt since 1961.

Here's [a chart of donations](http://www.treasurydirect.gov/govt/reports/pd/gift/gift.htm) over the past 15 years, averaging a couple million dollars every year, with an uptick after the 2008 financial crisis.


And here's [the Treasury website](https://www.pay.gov/public/form/start/23779454) for donations--they accept debit, credit, and PayPal too!
