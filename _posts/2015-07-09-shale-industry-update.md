Has a few interesting details on the status of the US Shale Energy Industry.  In summary, in reaction to low oil prices and OPEC's decision to continue pumping oil, the industry has become leaner & more agile, is focusing on more productive wells and stopping work on all others, and has shifted costs to the oil-services firms that provide them with equipment.  But meanwhile, many firms have become over-leveraged, have been relying on derivative hedges for income, and have been stymied by lousy returns on capital.
