I think this has been one of Obama's strongest speeches thus far.

IR thought: The religion of countries often gets brought up in English IR articles, especially for Islamic and Jewish countries.  Do IR articles in those countries mention the Christianity of the US and the heavily-Christian European countries?  

"President Obama delivers a eulogy for state Senator Clementa Pinckney, who was one of nine victims in the June 17, 2015, shooting at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, South Carolina."
