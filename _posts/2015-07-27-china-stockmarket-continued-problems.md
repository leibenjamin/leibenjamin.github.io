"The Shanghai Composite Index plunged 8.5 percent to 3,725.56 at the close, with 75 stocks dropping for each one that rose. PetroChina Co., long considered a target of state-linked market support funds, tumbled by a record 9.6 percent."

Obviously, there are the usual worries about political stability and contagion, since people often believe that there's some kind of informal contract in which the Chinese government guarantees economic growth in return for political obedience.

But overall, reporting on the Chinese stock markets has been a bit interesting.  I feel like there's been a certain glee and schadenfreude.
