I've heard of lots of US military biological/chemical weapons experiments over the years, but this one was news to me.

"In 1950, the US military conducted a test to see whether it could be used to help spread a biological weapon in a 'simulated germ-warfare attack.' This was just the start of many such tests around the country that would go on in secret for years."

And afterwards, it turned out that the bacteria the military used could be, and was in a few cases, fatal.

Article claims that this was a huge offense against the Nuremberg Code.  One of the cases, focusing on national law, lost in local courts, and not much else has been done in the legal system about this.  I wonder how UN commissions would judge this, though it likely could not be structured as a case between countries.
