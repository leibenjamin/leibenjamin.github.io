Basically, there are a bunch of abandoned Soviet uranium dumps leeching radioactive waste in Central Asia.  Many of them are badly maintained and are close to local water sources.

Governments are working with IOs (World Bank, IAEA, potentially EU) to get funds for relocating the dumps away from rivers, though relocation may stir up radioactive debris too.  A dangerous and frustrating situation all around.
