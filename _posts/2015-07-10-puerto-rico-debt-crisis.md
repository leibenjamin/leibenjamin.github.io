The Puerto Rico debt crisis has already been covered elsewhere.  Its $72 billion public debts are "not payable" and its economy remains lackluster--40% workforce-participation rate due to "rigid labour laws and [generous] welfare schemes".

What I found interesting was the discussion of how diasporas and historical guilt may affect public discourse.  Mainland politicians have been quite cautious and quiet about the debt issue.  The writer argues that this is due to:

1) Though the 3.5m residents can't vote in national elections, they have a diaspora of 5m in the mainland, of which 1m is in Florida, a swing state.  And in particular, many Puerto Ricans seem to be actual swing voters--they're willing to vote for both moderate Republicans and Democrats.

2) There is a sense of historical guilt that the US is responsible for Puerto Rico's long-term lackluster economy, both due to ineffectual central planning in the past and unhelpful policies even now (no foreign ships allowed for moving goods between PR and mainland, high federal minimum wage compared to PR average salary, high federal welfare benefits compared to PR average salary, inability to let currency fall due to currency union).
