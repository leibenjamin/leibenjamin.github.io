[1 hour podcast]

This American Life devoted a whole episode to this story.

"For July 4th, a story about someone who's desperately trying – against long odds – to make it to the United States and become an American. Abdi is a Somali refugee living in Kenya and gets the luckiest break of his life: he wins a lottery that puts him on a short list for a U.S. visa. This is his ticket out. But before he can cash in his golden ticket, the police start raiding his neighborhood, targeting refugees."

I often see these topics from a top-down view of reporting on governmental policies and statistics.  This was a very, very well-produced episode focusing on a single person: Abdi.
