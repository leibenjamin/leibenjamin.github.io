On the surface, this is a pretty normal story of Private Equity buying out a company, overloading it with debt, extracting profit, then selling off their shares before the company collapses.

But several details were particularly egregious.  The details are intricate enough such that The Economist's explanation is probably better than any summary I could write.  From the article:

At the time, Hellas looked to be in reasonable, if not stellar, shape: serving 20% of the Greek mobile market, it was making more than €110m in annual profit and its debt was a modest €187m. Within little more than a year of the deal, however, the group’s debt had been jacked up 15-fold. Much of this increase was the result of heavy borrowing to pay cash to redeem “convertible preferred-equity certificates” (CPECs), a bond-like instrument that can be converted to shares. The deal’s sponsors—vehicles set up by the private-equity firms to carry it out—had arranged for group companies to issue these notes to them in exchange for their equity contribution of €77m (the sponsors also lent the group more than €300m, which they later repaid themselves).

After siphoning out most of their investment through the CPECs, the owners sought to flip Hellas. When that failed, they quickly ramped up their withdrawals. This was done by arranging the redemption of most of the remaining CPECs at a controversial price.

Having allegedly taken out almost five times their total contribution (and almost 20 times their equity portion) in 18 months, the sponsors sold Hellas to an Egyptian investor in 2007. With insufficient income to service its debts, Hellas went into administration in 2009. 

...

The liquidators’ complaint is a colourful read that compares the private-equity firms’ windfall to the sack of Troy. It has several angles of attack. The first is the contention that the speed of the owners’ withdrawals was reckless. By autumn 2006, a year after they first bought in, they had already recouped 90% of their total €390m contribution, mostly by getting Hellas companies to borrow heavily and pay them back with the proceeds.

That leads to the second line of attack: the questionable valuation of the CPECs as withdrawals accelerated. In December 2006, €973m was passed along to the owners, via a chain of Hellas vehicles, as the bulk of remaining CPECs were redeemed (see chart). This redemption was unlike earlier ones, which were done at par value (the amount the holders originally paid for them). It was priced at a whopping 35 times par. The company tried to justify this on the ground that this was the security’s current “market” value. This allowed the owners to extract a lot more for each CPEC they held. Strikingly, weeks later those CPECs that were still to be redeemed were once again valued at par.

...

The buyer in 2007 was Weather Investments, controlled by Naguib Sawiris, an Egyptian. It wrote a cheque for €500m and took on Hellas’s €2.9 billion of debt. A year or so later, Apax paid the same amount, €500m, for a 5% stake in Weather.

The new owner moved Hellas’s domicile from Luxembourg to Britain, which offers a speedy form of bankruptcy known as a pre-packaged administration. It entered such a process in 2009, causing much of Hellas’s debt to be wiped out. Weather then bought the company back for €50m in cash and certain debt guarantees.
