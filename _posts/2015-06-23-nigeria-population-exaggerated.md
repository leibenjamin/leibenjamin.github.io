Short piece from The Economist issue's special report on Nigeria.  It covers a bunch of details on the wildly shifting population estimates from each census attempt and the likely overstating of the Northern population for the sake of receiving a larger share of the resource redistribution.

When discussing IR, I often cite relevant data.  But this is a reminder that the numbers may be misleading if I do not know the context and methodology behind them.
