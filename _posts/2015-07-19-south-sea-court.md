China has been refusing international arbitration over the Philippines' claim against China's 9-dashed line claims.  But amusingly, the Permanent Court of Arbitration has "ruled that documents issued by China to explain its objections 'constitute, in effect, a plea'", meaning that the case may go ahead despite China's refusal to participate.  The court is currently deciding whether it has jurisdiction over the case, which will not be announced till later in this year.
