Obama addresses African Union leaders, gets plaudits for his criticism of corruption, suppression of dissent, and leaders overstaying past term limits.

Apart from the article, the general discussion of Obama's administration and its African policies has been a bit interesting.  Some argue that Bush's administration did way more, and Obama has also failed to keep up with China's rapid gaining of influence in Africa.
