[2 page article]

The Economist article documents several governmental efforts to reach out to their diasporas, including Ireland's, India's, China's, and Mexico's.  Many of them are eyeing the success of Israel's efforts.

I wonder if this could be considered "anthro-mercantilism".  Countries' ability to attract human resources as both a cause and a reflection of their power.
