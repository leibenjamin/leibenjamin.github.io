[1 hour podcast]

Not IR-related per se, but is thought-provoking about organizational culture and multinational cooperation.

This American Life podcast: "A car plant in Fremont California that might have saved the U.S. car industry. In 1984, General Motors and Toyota opened NUMMI as a joint venture. Toyota showed GM the secrets of its production system: How it made cars of much higher quality and much lower cost than GM achieved. Frank Langfitt explains why GM didn't learn the lessonsâ€”until it was too late."
