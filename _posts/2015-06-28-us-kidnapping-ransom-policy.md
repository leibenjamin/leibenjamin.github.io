Summarized: "On June 24th Obama announced that no private citizen will be prosecuted for paying a ransom, and that officials are free to communicate with kidnappers and intermediaries.

But on the central question—whether Uncle Sam will pay ransoms—Mr Obama was firm."

A group of U of Texas researchers roughly "estimate that if a non-paying government were to start offering ransoms, the number of its citizens taken hostage would jump by at least 30%."

On the other hand, "the notion that extremists, surrounded by chaos, select victims by expected financial return is dubious."

Kidnapping ransoms might appear to be a relatively small matter compared to most international problems, but it's interesting to see how different governments approach the issue.
