[Half page article]

Hmm, a slightly different picture from consumption of cigarettes.  But I do wonder if spending is still increasing, presuming that people may desire pricier drinks as they grow richer.

"When measured by intake per head of the drinking-age population, consumption is down a little from a peak of 56.6 litres in 2012 to 55.4 litres in 2014.

People in rich countries are the ones imbibing lessâ€”a moderation that has not (yet) been matched by a corresponding binge in emerging markets. India, for instance, is the ninth-largest alcohol market, yet consumption per head is low. Small wonder that drinks companies see an enormous market waiting to be tapped."
