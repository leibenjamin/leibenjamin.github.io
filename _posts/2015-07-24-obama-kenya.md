NPR article on how Obama has been perceived in Kenya, ahead of his visit there.  There is a decent chunk of details that I hadn't heard of before.  His ancestral ethnic affiliations have become politicized.  I don't know if the journalist is overemphasizing Obama's presence in Kenya's popular imagination, but it's an interesting, short read nevertheless.
