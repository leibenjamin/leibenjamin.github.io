Just an amusing briefing from The Economist's weekly roundup:

"Bad blood was avoided when Apple performed an uncharacteristically swift climbdown regarding its new music-streaming service. After initially saying it would not pay royalties to artists whose songs were played during a free trial period, the computer giant decided everything had changed after Taylor Swift, an American superstar, threatened to withdraw her new album from the service. The firm says it will pay 73% of its music-subscription revenue to music owners."
