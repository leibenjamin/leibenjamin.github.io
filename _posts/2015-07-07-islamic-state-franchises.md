Just a short article looking at Daesh's 'franchises' beyond its Syrian & Iraqi territory, some more linked than others.

"Once Mr Baghdadi accepts a bay’a, or pledge of allegiance, IS declares a new 'province' of the caliphate. But according to Dabiq, IS’s English-language magazine, the group sets strict criteria for each affiliate. To have a chance of attracting favour, it must appoint a governor, set up a ruling council and implement IS’s version of Islamic rule. It must have a plan to conquer territory. With its claims to statehood, IS sets itself apart from other terrorists.

Dabiq also stresses a need for communication and says approved groups will receive support. But for the most part, even these recognised groups appear to have limited operational contact with IS’s leaders in Syria and Iraq. Its Libya outfit appears the most intertwined."
