The Economist gives a brief overview of the movement for divesting from fossil fuels, their successes, and their extremely slow progress.  Mostly an academic & business perspective.

"So far, the campaign has had more success with endowments and charities than with big pension funds. A survey conducted on behalf of the Independent Petroleum Association of America, an industry group, found that 88% of institutional investors were unlikely to be persuaded to divest by the campaign.
[...]
The ever-inventive finance industry has come up with low-carbon indices that track the overall market quite closely (a tracking error of 0.3% a year) but exclude the most polluting stocks in each sector.
[...]
For investors concerned by climate change, another option is engagement. [One investor suggests], 'The divestment campaign makes more people aware of the problem but it doesnâ€™t solve the issue. It merely passes it on to the next owner.'"

Has some implications for other divestment campaigns, especially the Israeli-settlements one.  But also interesting just 'cause Stanford is mentioned in the article, since Stanford was one of the institutions that has divested from coal.  IIRC, Stanford hasn't committed to divesting from other fossil fuels yet.
