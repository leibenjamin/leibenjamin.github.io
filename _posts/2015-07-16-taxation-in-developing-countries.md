The article mentions the "crowding in" effect, in which public investment attracts private investment.  In one World Bank estimate, "an additional dollar of public investment increases the private sort by two dollars".

"Very poor" countries currently collect 13% of GDP in taxes on average, compared to 34% in the rich world.

Also of note is the discussion of ways to increase tax collection policies (automation increased tax revenue in Rwadanda by 6.5 times) and choosing better types of taxes (property taxes are more efficient and less discouraging of productive activity).  The article also mentions other tweaks, like simplifying the formula for assessing property values, improving statellite mapping usage, and reducing tax exemptions among foreign investors.

"Helping poor countries improve tax collection and limit avoidance may do far more for growth than setting lofty aid targets."
