Just a brief Economist overview of how various Salafist groups are doing in the Middle East.

"The movement is often broken down into three categories. The most infamous are the jihadists, who are but a tiny minority. The most numerous are the purists (or quietists), who believe that politics undercuts the sovereignty of God and is therefore best avoided. Like the Wahhabis in Saudi Arabia, most bend a knee to Muslim heads of state, no matter how awful, in order to avoid creating fitna, or chaos.

Activist Salafists, those involved in politics, make up the third group."

It's the size of this third group that both rises and ebbs a lot since the Arab spring began, based on their local successes and level of regime persecution.
