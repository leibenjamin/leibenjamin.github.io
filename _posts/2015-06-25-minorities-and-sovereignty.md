"Some of historyâ€™s most victimised peoples are obliterated; others eventually achieve statehood. Why?"

It's an interesting and relevant question nowadays, though The Economist doesn't go into much depth.  The article looks at several minority groups in the Middle East & Central Asia.

In a following article ("Back into exile"), The Economist overviews the Crimean Tartars' displacement and Mustafa Dzehemilev's long struggle to advocate for his people.

Relevant 'cause last year Putin tried to entice Dzehemilev to support his Ukraine policies in return for fulfilling Dzehemilev's wishes, but Dzehemilev wanted the Russian troops to leave Crimea.

Dzehemilev's closing statement at a trial in 1983: "Fourteen years ago I vowed that nobody ever under any circumstances would make me renounce my duty...Today I can repeat these vows and hope that I would have enough spiritual strength not to change this principle to the end of my days."
