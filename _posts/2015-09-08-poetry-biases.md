Lede: "A white poet uses a Chinese pseudonymâ€”and a poem rejected 40 times is named one of America's best."

I've been unimpressed with The Atlantic's political coverage in recent years, but they still come up with interesting articles at times. This one is a nice case study of when biases, culture, and art meet. The anthology editor's measured response is interesting in terms of PR too.
