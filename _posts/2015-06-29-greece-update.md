Decently thorough overview of the current situation.  I'm a little surprised that Alexis Tsipras is calling a referendum on it; referendums don't seem to have a good history for crises like this.  I'll be curious to take a closer look at the breakdown of the Greek government's budget and projections for balancing it.
