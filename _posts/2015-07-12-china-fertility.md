Unless if the current structure of the economy and welfare change a lot, China will likely be in lots of trouble in 20 or so years.  Its overall fertility rate is at 1.6 and is at 1 in most major cities.  This problem is obviously not exclusive for China, but the interesting bit is that its relaxation of the one-child policy hasn't increased fertility rates.

The article also covers the fact that China's fertility rate would have likely declined just as much without the one-child policy.
