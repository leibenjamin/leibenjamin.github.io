"The population, of about 5.5m now, has doubled in the past 30 years and is still expanding. In 2013 a government white paper forecast that it would increase to 5.8m-6m by 2020 and 6.5m-6.9m by 2030."

"Already, probably more than half the people living in Singapore were not born there. That proportion seems likely to rise. Singapore has always been an immigrant society, quick to assimilate newcomers. But that openness and tolerance has frayed as some Singaporeans have felt crowded out, and foreigners are blamed for pushing up property prices and holding down wages."

"The government argued the proposed levels of immigration would be necessary to maintain even moderate growth because Singaporeans are not reproducing themselves. Last year the “total fertility rate” (TFR), a notional estimate of the number of babies a woman will have over her lifetime, was 1.25, way below the replacement rate of about 2.1. Singapore is tumbling off a demographic cliff. From 2020 the number of working-age Singaporeans will decline, and by 2030 there will be only 2.1 workers for every citizen over the age of 64, compared with 6 last year."
