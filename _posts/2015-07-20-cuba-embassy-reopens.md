One aspect I found interesting was that the embassy had been supervised by Switzerland since 1971 as an "interests section".  And now it's reopening in the same building as the interests section and the pre-1961 embassy.  Similarly, I know that Taiwan has an "Economic and Cultural Representative Office" instead of formal embassies in the US.
