The Economist overviews several of the militant Islamist groups in West, North, and East Africa.

Seeral generalizations from the article:
Although the extremist groups are backed by well-financed elites, they could not survive without popular support. Every one of them taps into well-known local grievances. From Mali and Nigeria to Kenya and Tanzania the story is the same: extremists emerge from and woo Muslim populations on the national periphery who are fed up with decades of neglect, discrimination and mistreatment by their rulers. Jihadists are able to exploit existing religious tensions and latch on to disgruntled Muslim communities.

In addition, the conflicts that they stir up have created ever bigger populations of refugees, who are either vulnerable to radicalisation or likely to cause the sort of resentment that fuels it.

Increasingly what drives African extremism is not just opportunity or firepower but ideology. No grand caliphate stretching from Mosul in northern Iraq to Maiduguri in north-eastern Nigeria is likely to emerge. Yet a distinct flavour of poisonous thinking has spread across thousands of miles. Islamism is the continent’s new ideology of protest.

As such it is almost uniquely powerful. African politics tends to revolve around tribal and ethnic loyalties. But that leaves a wide political space unclaimed. A group like the Somalis’ Shabab is able to position itself as 'above tribe'.

Only genuine political competition could change this dynamic. Yet most ethnic and tribal leaders have little interest in upsetting their own hold on power. African and Western governments are thus left to counter jihadism by force of arms. France has set up a 3,000-strong rapid-response force in Chad with six fighter jets and 20 helicopters. America has built drone bases across the continent."
