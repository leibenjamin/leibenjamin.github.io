Oh boy.  US public-sector pension funds have had their funding rations--the proportion of liabilities covered by assets--fall from around 90% in 2001 to 74% in 2014.

And this is just the average.  "A fifth of all schemes have a funding ratio of less than 60%—a group that includes not just the usual suspects in Illinois and New Jersey but some in Alaska, Arizona, Connecticut and Kentucky."

And even more egregiously, the actual funding ratio numbers are even worse than officially reported due to financial gimmicks.

"Most liabilities of a pension plan fall well into the future—a stream of payments to current and future beneficiaries who may live into their 90s. These payments must be discounted to work out the sum in contemporary dollars needed to cover them, but at what rate? Private-sector pension plans are required to use long-dated AA-rated corporate-bond yields, currently around 4%. But public-sector plans are allowed to use the expected return on their investments, which they estimate to be 7.6% on average."

"This more generous approach means the aggregate deficit of public-sector plans is “just” $1.1 trillion. But if public plans used the same discount rate as private ones, the deficit would increase to $3.9 trillion and the funding ratio fall to 45%."

Meanwhile, "states only cough up seven-eighths of the required payments, so the hole is growing ever bigger."

"American companies have an aggregate pension deficit of $389 billion, or $585 billion if other post-retirement benefits (largely health care) are included."

But at least the private pension funds are using the more reasonable discount rate of around 4%, instead of the public sector's average of 7.6%.  I have long heard that pension deficits have been a problem, but the actual numbers are quite sobering.  And it's a bit depressing that other countries are facing similar problems.
